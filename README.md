# Milestone 7: Backend Endpoint for User Login
Welcome to Milestone 7! In this milestone, you‚Äôll create a backend endpoint for user login, focusing on validating user credentials and verifying encrypted passwords stored in the database. Let‚Äôs break it down step by step.

Learning Goals 
By the end of this milestone, you will:

Understand how to validate user credentials during login.

Learn how to compare the encrypted password with the user‚Äôs input.

Why Encrypt Passwords?
Protect User Data: Keeps passwords safe even if the database is compromised.

Privacy: Ensures passwords aren‚Äôt stored in plain text.

Compliance: Meets security standards like GDPR and PCI-DSS.

Prevents Password Theft: Hashed passwords are difficult to decipher, increasing security.

How Login Authentication Works 
User Enters Credentials:

The user provides their email/username and password on the login page.

Fetch User Data from Database:

The backend retrieves the user record based on the provided email/username.

If the user is not found, return an error: "User does not exist."

Compare Encrypted Passwords:

Process the user's input password using the same hashing algorithm (e.g., bcrypt).

Compare the resulting hash to the stored hashed password.

If they match, the user is authenticated; if not, send an error.

# Milestone 8: Creating and Displaying Card Components
Welcome to Milestone 8!  In this milestone, you‚Äôll learn how to create a card component and display multiple cards on the products page. This will help you showcase products effectively and improve the user experience of your e-commerce app.

Learning Goals 
By the end of this milestone, you will:

Learn how to create a card component.

Learn how to display those cards on the products page.

Why Create Card Components?
Showcase Products Effectively: Presents product details in a clear and visually appealing way.

Reusable Design: Can be used across multiple pages or sections of the app.

Improved User Experience: Makes it easy for users to browse and interact with products.

Organized Layout: Keeps the homepage clean and structured.

How to Display a Single Card for Multiple Products?
Create a Dynamic Component: Design a single card component that accepts product details as props.

Use Mapping: Use array mapping to iterate over the product list and render a card for each product.

Pass Data Dynamically: Pass unique product information (e.g., name, price, image) to each card.

Maintain Consistency: Ensure the layout remains uniform for all products.

## *Milestone 9*
-Product Form with Multiple Image Upload

This project focuses on designing a user-friendly product form that allows users to enter product details and upload multiple images. The form ensures a smooth and efficient way to manage product information, making it suitable for e-commerce platforms, inventory systems, or online marketplaces.  

The form includes fields for essential product details such as name, description, price, category, and stock quantity. It also provides an intuitive image upload feature where users can select multiple images at once. This enhances product presentation by allowing detailed visual representation.  

To ensure data accuracy, the form implements validation rules, requiring users to input necessary information and upload images in supported formats. The ability to preview images before submission further improves user experience by allowing verification of uploaded files.  

By integrating multiple image uploads, this form enhances the way products are displayed, helping businesses and sellers showcase their items more effectively. It is designed with simplicity and efficiency in mind, making product management seamless¬†and¬†convenient.
