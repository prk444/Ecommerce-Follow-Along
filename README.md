## Milestone 2: Frontend - Login Page

In this milestone, I focused on creating the frontend for the login page. I structured the application by setting up a `components` folder where I created the `Login.jsx` component. Additionally, I organized the layout by creating a `pages` folder, which includes `Home.jsx`, `Login.jsx`, and `Navbar.jsx` components. These components work together to provide a seamless user experience, with a functional and visually clean login page for the e-commerce platform.


## Setup and Installation

To get started with the project locally:

### 1. Clone the repository




### Milestone 2
In Milestone 2, we've moved the e-commerce application to the next level. Having completed Milestone 1, we have focused on structuring the project, setting up both the frontend and backend environments, and building the first user-facing feature ‚Äì the Login Page. In this milestone, we ensure the project is structured and organized for what features will come in.

Learning Goals ????
We have for the end of this milestone

Implemented project file organisation, making sure everything is organized and in place in the project
Set up a React frontend app to do the UI layout
Configured a Node.js server for our backend, that will be prepared for API handling
Integrated Tailwind CSS and used utility classes to make things easier with respect to styling classes.
Developed a functional/styled Login page for the front end, thereby ensuring a smoothen experience for the end user.
Feature Implemented????Ô∏è
- +1.Project Folder Structure.
frontend: Holds all files relating to React.
backend: Has the Node.js server and subsequent API files
- +2. Setup of React Frontend
Activated the frontend by using React to create dynamic UIs
Installed dependencies like React Router for routing
- +3. Setup of Node.js Backend
Activated a minimal Node.js server with Express for subsequent API requests
- +4. Tailwind CSS Setup
Activated Tailwind CSS to make styling of the applications look a lot cleaner and more modern in nature and response.
Installed PostCSS for maximum comfort with developing using Tailwind CSS.
- +5. Building Login Page
Logged-in Page has been designed as the initial functionality of the e-commerce platform.
It was made using Tailwind CSS so it has an incredibly clean design with modern style
Basic fields included were Email, Password fields with a submit button.
Has potential to implement new functionalities (in this case authentication).

### Database Connection
The database connection is established using Mongoose. The connection configuration is located in connection.js



### Milestone 4

Learning Goals 
By the end of this milestone, you will:
Create a User Model: This is like a blueprint for how your users' data will be stored in the database.
Create a User Controller: This will help you manage what happens with your user data (like adding a new user or getting their information).
Enable and configure Multer: Multer will allow your app to accept and store files (such as images) uploaded by users.
Update the README file: Don‚Äôt forget to document your progress!
1. What‚Äôs a Model?
A model is like a detailed map or plan. When you create a User Model, you‚Äôre designing how a user‚Äôs data (like name, email, and password) will look in the database. Imagine drawing a blueprint of a house. The model is the map of what information you need to store for each user. In MongoDB, we use something called Schemas to create a model. A schema is a definition of what data should look like for that model.

2. What‚Äôs a Controller?
A controller is a special part of the server that decides what happens when someone interacts with your app. For example, if someone wants to sign up for your website, the controller will handle what happens when the data is sent to the server. Think of the controller as a "manager" of requests and responses. It‚Äôs like the teacher in a classroom‚Äîtelling the students (your app) what to do and ensuring everything goes smoothly.
